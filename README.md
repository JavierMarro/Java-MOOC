# Java_MOOC

Some of the most relevant code produced while taking the Java programming MOOC (I and II) by the University of Helsinki.

All content uploaded to this repository comes from https://java-programming.mooc.fi/, however solutions to all problems are my own, and any solutions from the University of Helsinki have been adequately labelled as either 'Suggested answer' or 'Model answer'.
